# Use Cases

We provide short articles on common data science scenarios that MLEM can help
with or improve. You can combine different scenarios for even more awesomeness.

Our use cases are not written to be run end-to-end like tutorials. For more
general, hands-on experience with MLEM, please see [Get Started](/doc/get-started)
instead.

## Why MLEM?

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning, data scientists
and machine learning engineers still lack a simple way to deploy their models in
fast and easily manageable way. This is a critical challenge: while ML
algorithms and methods are no longer tribal knowledge, they are still difficult
to serve, scale and maintain in production.

## Basic uses of MLEM

If you train Machine Learning models and you want to

- save machine learning models along with all metainformation that is required
  to run them;
- pack your models into ready-to-use format like Python packages or Docker
  Images;
- deploy your models, easily switching between different providers when you need
  to;
- adopt engineering tools and best practices in data science projects;

MLEM is for you!
