# Versioning MLEM objects with DVC

<details>

### 🧳 Requirements

`pip install mlem dvc[azure]`

</details>

Often it’s a bad idea to store binary files in git, especially big ones. To
solve this MLEM can utilize DVC capabilities to connect external cloud storage
for model and dataset versioning.

> You can learn more about DVC [here](https://dvc.org/doc).

We will reorganize our example repo to use DVC.

## Setting up repo

First, let’s initialize DVC and add a remote (we will use azure, but you can use
whatever is available to you):

```dvc
$ dvc init
$ dvc remote add myremote -d azure://example-mlem
$ git add .dvc/config
```

Now, we also need to setup MLEM so it knows to use DVC.

```mlem
$ mlem config set default_storage.type dvc
✅  Set `default_storage.type` to `dvc` in repo .
```

Also, let’s add `.mlem` files to `.dvcignore` so that metafiles are ignored by
DVC

```bash
$ echo "/**/?*.mlem" > .dvcignore
$ git add .dvcignore
```

## Saving objects

Next, let’s remove artifacts from git and re-save them, so MLEM can use new
storage for them. You don't need to change a single line of code

```bash
$ git rm -r --cached .mlem/
$ python prepare.py
$ python train.py
```

Finally, let’s add new metafiles to git and artifacts to DVC respectively,
commit and push them

```bash
$ dvc add .mlem/model/rf .mlem/dataset/*.csv
$ git add .mlem
$ git commit -m "Switch to dvc storage"
$ dvc push -r myremote
$ git push
```

Now, you can load MLEM objects from your repo even though there are no actual
binaries stored in git. MLEM will know to use DVC to load them.

# Using MLEM in DVC Pipeline

DVC pipelines are the useful DVC mechanism to build data pipelines, in which you
can process your data and train your model. You may be already training your ML
models in them and what to start using MLEM to save those models.

MLEM could be easily plug in into existing DVC pipelines. If you already added
`.mlem` files to `.dvcignore`, you are good to go for most of the cases. Since
DVC will ignore `.mlem` files, you don't need to add them as outputs and mark
them with `cache: false`.

It becomes a bit more complicated when you need to add them as outputs, because
you want to use them as inputs to next stages. The case may be when model binary
doesn't change for you, but model metadata does. That may happen if you change
things like model description or labels.

To work with that, you'll need to remove `.mlem` files from `.dvcignore` and
mark your outputs in DVC Pipeline with `cache: false`.

## Example

You may have a simple pipeline in which you train your model, like this:

```yaml
# dvc.yaml
stages:
  train:
    cmd: python train.py models/rf
    deps:
      - train.py
    outs:
      - models/rf
```

Next step would be to start saving your models with MLEM. Since MLEM saves both
**binary** and **metadata** you need to have both of them in DVC pipeline:

```yaml
# dvc.yaml
stages:
  train:
    cmd: python train.py models/rf
    deps:
      - train.py
    outs:
      - models/rf
      - models/rf.mlem:
          cache: false
```

Since binary was already captured before, we don't need to add anything for it.
For metadata, we've added two rows to capture it and specify `cache: false`
since we want the metadata to be committed to Git, and not be pushed to DVC
remote.

Now MLEM is ready to be used in your DVC pipeline!
