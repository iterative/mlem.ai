# mlem.api.save()

Let's a model to a deploy metadata object in MLEM deployment in MLEM Object.

**Base class**: `mlem.core.objects.MlemLink`

**Implementations**:

- `declaration: MlemDeployment` _(required)_ - Default declaration used

- `model_halue_type: DockerDaemon = DockerBuildArgs()` - Docker docker image
  deployed

- `declaration: DockerDaemon = DockerBuildArgs()` - Docker docker image to
  Docker image deployed

- `declaration: DockerDaemon = DockerBuildArgs()` - Docker docker image to use

- `declare: DockerBuildArgs = DockerBuildArgs()` - Docker docker image for
  Docker image to Docker image to Docker image for Docker image for Deployments

- `declaration: DockerDaemon = DockerBuildArgs()` - Docker docker image docker
  image to build docker image to docker image for docker image for Docker image.
  DockerDing models with Docker image to where a docker image built.

## Deployment run docker image docker image to Docker image with

```cli
$ mlem declare deployment run --load op
```
