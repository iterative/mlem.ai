# GTO with DVC

Large files are typically not stored in a Git repository, so they need to be
downloaded from external sources. [DVC](https://dvc.org) is a great way to store
your GTO artifact files while keeping a pointer in the repo, and simplifying
[data management] and synchronization.

### Learn about different approaches to this

1. You can commit artifacts to Git repo. If they aren't small enough, this is
   not recommended. To bypass this limitation, you can use
   [Git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).
2. You can version binaries with [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and commit pointers to
   them to the repo. This is the recommended approach for large files.
3. You can version binaries manually somewhere, specifying URL to them as `path`
   in `artifacts.yaml`. This can be done, if your artifacts are already
   versioned by some external system.

## Tracking an artifact with DVC

First, we need to start tracking artifact with DVC. If you produce this artifact
in DVC Pipelines, it's done automatically.

If the artifact is located inside your Git repo, you can use `dvc add`:

```cli
$ dvc add model.pkl
$ git add model.pkl.dvc
```

If the artifact is located in some external storage, we can use `dvc import-url`
to still keep metainformation about it in the repo (use `--no-download` to skip
downloading it):

```cli
$ dvc import-url --no-download s3://container/model.pkl
$ git add model.pkl.dvc
```

## Annotating DVC-tracked artifacts

Once the artifact is tracked with DVC within your repo, we can annotate it with
GTO:

```cli
$ gto annotate model --path model.pkl
```

This will write the following to `artifacts.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  path: model.pkl
```

Commit the changes to Git in order to `gto register` artifact versions and
`gto assign` them to deployment stages referencing the new commit.

```cli
$ git add artifacts.yaml
$ git commit -m "version artifact binaries with DVC and annotate it with GTO"
$ git push
```

Now your changes is live in your Git repo and you can download your artifact to
use it ðŸ™Œ

## Downloading artifacts

When you want to download GTO artifact which binaries are stored with DVC, you
need to use `dvc get` or `dvc import` command:

```cli
$ dvc get $REPO $ARTIFACT_PATH --rev $REVISION -o $OUTPUT_PATH
```

Check out [User Guide](/doc/gto/user-guide#getting-artifacts-downstream) to
learn how to find out `ARTIFACT_PATH` and `REVISION`.

### Example: downloading from outside the repo

If you need to download the latest version of `model`, that would be:

```cli
$ REVISION=$(gto show --repo $REPO model@greatest --ref)
$ ARTIFACT_PATH=$(gto describe --repo $REPO $ARTIFACT --rev $REVISION --path)
$ dvc get $REPO $ARTIFACT --rev $REVISION -o $ARTIFACT_PATH
```

### Example: downloading in CI

If you need to download an artifact from the same repo, that would be a bit
simpler (taking GH Actions as an example):

```cli
$ ARTIFACT_PATH=$(gto describe model --rev $GITHUB_REF --path)
$ dvc pull $ARTIFACT_PATH
```
