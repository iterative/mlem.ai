# User Guide

GTO helps you build a Artifact Registry out of your Git repository. It does so
by creating Git tags of [special format](/doc/gto/user-guide) and managing
[`artifacts.yaml` metafile](/doc/gto/user-guide). Since committing large files
to Git is not a good practice, you shouldn't commit binary files to Git.
Instead, use
[DVC, Git-lfs, or any method commit pointers to the binary files instead](/doc/gto/user-guide/storages).

Our guides describe the major concepts in GTO and how it works comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use what, as well as inter-relationship between them.

The topics here range from more foundational (impacting many parts of GTO) to
more specific and advanced things you can do.
