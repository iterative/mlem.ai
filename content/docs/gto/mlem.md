# Deploy models with MLEM

Creating model versions and assigning stages in Model Registry is usually done
to trigger some action downstream. To easily build Docker images with your
models for new model versions, or simply deploy them upon stage assignments, you
can use [MLEM](/doc).

If you're new to MLEM, please head to [Get Started](/doc/get-started) to learn
MLEM basics.

## Annotating MLEM models with GTO

A model saved by MLEM typically consists of a model binary file (for example,
`nn.pkl`) and a metadata file (`nn.pkl.mlem`).

To annotate a model with GTO:

```cli
$ gto annotate model --path nn.pkl
```

This will modify `artifacts.yaml`, adding:

```yaml
model:
  path: nn.pkl
```

Now you should commit changes to Git, and you can register versions and assign
stages referencing the new commit.

```cli
$ git add artifacts.yaml
$ git commit -m "annotate MLEM model with GTO"
$ git push
```

Now your changes is live in your Git repo and ready to be used ðŸ™Œ

## Creating a CI/CD workflow

Since Git tags can trigger a CI/CD workflow, now we need to add the workflow we
need to the repo.

<tab title="GitHub: build a Docker image">

This workflow will build a docker image out of the model and push it to a
DockerHub ([learn more](/doc/user-guide/building) about configuring build and
using other destinations).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  act:
    name: Build a Docker image for new model versions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - id: gto
        uses: iterative/gto-action@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - if: steps.gto.outputs.event == 'registration'
        run: |
          # TODO: check this works
          # What credentials we need to specify to publish image somewhere?
          mlem build docker \
              --model '${{ steps.gto.outputs.path }}' \
              --image.name ${{ steps.gto.outputs.name }} \
              --image.tag '${{ steps.gto.outputs.version }}' \
              --env.registry docker_io
```

</tab>
<tab title="GitHub: deploy a model">

This workflow will deploy a model to Heroku upon stage assignment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

env:
  HEROKU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }} # credentials needed to run deployment
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }} # creds needed to keep deployment state
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

jobs:
  act:
    name: Deploy a model upon stage assignment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - id: gto
        uses: iterative/gto-action@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - if: steps.gto.outputs.event == 'registration'
        run: |
          # TODO: check this works
          mlem deployment run \
            --load deploy/${{ steps.gto.outputs.stage }} \
            --model ${{ steps.gto.outputs.path }}
```

This relies on having deployment declarations in the `deploy` directory, such
as:

```yaml
# deploy/dev.yaml
object_type: deployment
type: heroku
app_name: mlem-dev
```

This declaration is read by MLEM in CI and the model promoted to `dev` is
deployed to https://mlem-dev.herokuapp.com.

Check out [another example](https://github.com/iterative/example-gto/tree/mlem)
of MLEM model deployment in the `main` branch of the `example-gto` repo.
