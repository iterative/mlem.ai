# GTO Documentation

**GTO** is a tool for creating an Artifact Registry in your Git repository. One
of the special cases we would like to highlight is creating a **Machine Learning
Model Registry**.

Such a registry serves as a centralized place to store and operationalize your
artifacts along with their metadata; manage model life-cycle, versions &
releases, and easily automate tests and deployments using GitOps.
