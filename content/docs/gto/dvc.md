# GTO with DVC

While GTO enables building an Artifact Registry in Git repo, it doesn't version
artifact binaries themselves. This guide will show how to do that with DVC, and
use GTO with DVC.

<details>

### Learn about different approaches to this

1. You can commit artifacts to Git repo. If they aren't small enough, this is
   not recommended. To bypass this limitation, you can try using Git-lfs.
2. You can version binaries with [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and commit pointers to
   them to the repo. This is the recommended approach for large files.
3. You can version binaries manually somewhere, specifying URL to them as `path`
   in `artifacts.yaml`. This can be done, if your artifacts are already
   versioned by some external system.

</details>

If you are new to DVC, you should start with
[DVC Get Started](https://dvc.org/doc/start) first, and then come back to this
Guide.

<!-- ```

dvc init --no-scm dvc remote add az azure://container-name export
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING='YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING'

dvc import-url --no-download azure://container-name/data.parquet

``` -->

## Tracking an artifact with DVC

First, we need to start tracking artifact with DVC. If you produce this artifact
in DVC Pipelines, it's done automatically.

If the artifact is located inside your Git repo, you can use `dvc add`:

```cli
$ dvc add model.pkl
$ git add model.pkl.dvc
```

If the artifact is located in some external storage, we can use `dvc import-url`
to still keep metainformation about it in the repo (use `--no-download` to skip
downloading it):

```cli
$ dvc import-url --no-download s3://container/model.pkl
$ git add model.pkl.dvc
```

## Annotating DVC-tracked artifacts

Once the artifact is tracked with DVC within your repo, we can annotate it with
GTO:

```cli
$ gto annotate model --path model.pkl
```

This will modify `artifacts.yaml`, adding:

```yaml
model:
  path: model.pkl
```

Now you should commit changes to Git, and you can register versions and assign
stages referencing the new commit.

```cli
$ git add artifacts.yaml
$ git commit -m "version artifact binaries with DVC and annotate it with GTO"
$ git push
```

Now your changes is live in your Git repo and you can download your artifact to
use it ðŸ™Œ

## Downloading artifacts

When you want to download GTO artifact which binaries are stored with DVC, you
need to use `dvc import` command:

```cli
$ dvc import $REPO $ARTIFACT_PATH \
    --rev $REVISION -o $NEW_ARTIFACT_PATH
```

<admon type="tip">

Usually you would have the right revision (such as in CI - it would be the Git
tag that triggered it), but if you need to download the latest version, you can
use:

```cli
$ gto show --repo https://github.com/iterative/example-gto \
    churn@greatest --ref
```

For a model version in stage, that will be:

```cli
$ gto show --repo https://github.com/iterative/example-gto \
    churn#dev --ref
```

</admon>

Artifact path can be discovered by `gto describe`:

```cli
$ gto describe model --rev $REVISION
```

### Example: downloading from outside the repo

Uniting this pieces together, if you need to download the latest version of
`model` from outside:

```cli
$ REVISION=$(gto show --repo $REPO model@greatest --ref)
$ ARTIFACT_PATH=$(gto describe --repo $REPO $ARTIFACT --rev $REVISION --path)
$ dvc import $REPO $ARTIFACT --rev $REVISION -o $ARTIFACT_PATH
```

### Example: downloading in CI

In CI that would be a bit simpler (taking GH Actions as an example):

```cli
$ ARTIFACT_PATH=$(gto describe model --rev $GITHUB_REF --path)
$ dvc import . model --rev $GITHUB_REF -o $ARTIFACT_PATH
```

<!--
Refer to DVC install guide and Get Started to learn DVC first. If you're already
familiar with DVC, let's set it up for GTO repo (use your remote storage instead
of `s3://mybucket/myrepo`):

```cli
$ dvc init
$ dvc remote add myremote -d s3://mybucket/myrepo
$ git add .dvc/config
```

##

If you want to version your artifact with DVC, you need to add it to DVC first
(skip this step if you already have DVC-tracked artifacts):

```cli
$ dvc add path/to/artifact
$ dvc push
$ git add
``` -->
