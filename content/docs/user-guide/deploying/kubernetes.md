# Kubernetes

To serve models in production in a scalable and failure-safe way, one needs
something more than Heroku. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) is an
open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications.

Below, we will deploy a model to a kubernetes cluster exposing its prediction
endpoints through a service.

## Requirements

```cli
pip install mlem[kubernetes]
# or
pip install kubernetes docker
```

### Prerequisites

In order to deploy your model-server on a K8s cluster, you must first have a
ready setup. Namely:

- Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster properly set up and accessible, with
  the corresponding kubeconfig file available. It doesn't matter which flavour -
  vanilla, GKE, EKS, AKS, Openshift, etc. If you're using multiple kubeconfig or
  a non-default kubeconfig location, check out
  [the section below](#specifying-a-custom-kubeconfig).
- Your local machine and the target cluster both have access to a docker
  registry. MLEM will build and push the image from your executor machine, and
  the k8s cluster will need to have access and permissions to pull those images.
- Relevant permissions to create resources on the cluster -- deployment,
  service, etc. are present.
- Nodes are accessible and reachable, with some external IP address (if you're
  using a NodePort service to expose your server, more details below).

<admon type="tip">

As a quick sanity command - try runnign `kubectl get pods` to check your cluster
is reachable and kubeconfig configured correctly. See the
[Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) to
learn more about the concepts above.

</admon>

## Description

Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster involves 2 main steps:

1. Build the docker image and upload it to a registry.
2. Create resources on the Kubernetes cluster -- specifically, a `namespace`, a
   `deployment` and a `service`.

Once this is done, one can use the usual workflow of
[`mlem deployment run`](/doc/command-reference/deployment/run) to deploy on
Kubernetes.

### Specifying a custom kubeconfig

MLEM tries to find the kubeconfig file from the environment variable
`KUBECONFIG` or the default location `~/.kube/config`.

If you need to use another path, one can pass it with

`--kube_config_file_path ...`

<admon type="tip">

You can use `mlem deploy run kubernetes -h` to list all the configurable
parameters.

</admon>

Most of the configurable parameters in the list above come with sensible
defaults. But at the least, one needs to follow the structure given below:

```cli
$ mlem deployment run kubernetes service_name \
    --model model \
    --service_type loadbalancer
üíæ Saving deployment to service_name.mlem
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading model from model.mlem

  üíº Generating requirements file...
  üõ† Building docker image ml:4ee45dc33804b58ee2c7f2f6be447cda...
  ‚úÖ  Built docker image ml:4ee45dc33804b58ee2c7f2f6be447cda
namespace created. status='{'conditions': None, 'phase': 'Active'}'
deployment created. status='{'available_replicas': None,
 'collision_count': None,
 'conditions': None,
 'observed_generation': None,
 'ready_replicas': None,
 'replicas': None,
 'unavailable_replicas': None,
 'updated_replicas': None}'
service created. status='{'conditions': None, 'load_balancer': {'ingress': None}}'
‚úÖ  Deployment ml is up in mlem namespace
```

where:

- `service_name` is a name of one's own choice, of which corresponding
  `service_name.mlem` and `service_name.mlem.state` files will be created.
- `model` denotes the path to model saved via `mlem`.
- `service_type` is configurable and is passed as `loadbalancer`. The default
  value is `nodeport` if not passed.

### Checking the docker images

One can check the docker image built via `docker image ls` which should give the
following output:

```
REPOSITORY   TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ml           4ee45dc33804b58ee2c7f2f6be447cda   16cf3d92492f   3 minutes ago   778MB
...
```

### Checking the kubernetes resources

Pods created can be checked via `kubectl get pods -A` which should have a pod in
the `mlem` namespace present as shown below:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
kube-system   coredns-6d4b75cb6d-xp68b   1/1     Running   7 (12m ago)    7d22h
...
kube-system   storage-provisioner        1/1     Running   59 (11m ago)   54d
mlem          ml-cddbcc89b-zkfhx         1/1     Running   0              5m58s
```

By default, all resources are created in the `mlem` namespace. This ofcourse is
configurable using `--namespace prod` where `prod` is the desired namespace
name.

### Making predictions via MLEM

One can of course use the
[`mlem deployment apply`](/doc/command-reference/deployment/apply) command to
ping the deployed endpoint to get the predictions back. An example could be:

```cli
$ mlem deployment apply service_name data --json
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

where `data` is the dataset saved via `mlem`.

### Deleting the Kubernetes resources

A model can easily be undeployed using `mlem deploy remove service_name` which
will delete the `pods`, `services` and the `namespace` i.e. clear the resources
from the cluster. The docker image will still persist in the registry though.

## Swapping the model in deployment

If you want to change the model that is currently under deployment, run

```cli
$ mlem deploy run --load service_name --model other-model
```

This will build a new docker image corresponding to the `other-model` and will
terminate the existing pod and create a new one, thereby replacing it, without
downtime.

This can be seen below:

### Checking the docker images

```
REPOSITORY   TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
ml           d57e4cacec82ebd72572d434ec148f1d   9bacd4cd9cc0   11 minutes ago      2.66GB
ml           4ee45dc33804b58ee2c7f2f6be447cda   26cb86b55bc4   About an hour ago   778MB
...
```

Notice how a new docker image with the tag `d57e4cacec82ebd72572d434ec148f1d` is
built.

### Checking the deployment process

```cli
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading model from other-model.mlem
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading deployment from service_name.mlem
üõ† Creating docker image ml
  üõ† Building MLEM wheel file...
  üíº Adding model files...
  üõ† Generating dockerfile...
  üíº Adding sources...
  üíº Generating requirements file...
  üõ† Building docker ml:d57e4cacec82ebd72572d434ec148f1d...
  ‚úÖ  Built docker image ml:d57e4cacec82ebd72572d434ec148f1d
‚úÖ  Deployment ml is up in mlem namespace
```

Here, an existing deployment i.e. `service_name` is used but with a newer model.
Hence, details of registry need not be passed again. The contents of
`service_name` can be checked by inspecting the `service_name.mlem` file.

### Checking the kubernetes resources

We can see the existing pod being terminated and the new one running in its
place below:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   aws-node-pr8cn        1/1     Running       0          90m
...
kube-system   kube-proxy-dfxsv      1/1     Running       0          90m
mlem          ml-66b9588df5-wmc2v   1/1     Running       0          99s
mlem          ml-cddbcc89b-zkfhx    1/1     Terminating   0          60m
```

## Example: Using EKS cluster with ECR on AWS

The deployment to a cloud managed kubernetes cluster such as
[EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) is
simple and analogous to how it is done in the steps above for a local cluster
(such as minikube).

<admon type="info">

To set up an EKS cluster, you can use [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/):

```cli
eksctl create cluster --name cluster-name --region us-east-1
```

> This will provision an EKS cluster with default parameters, such as two
> `m5.large` worker nodes.

Other tools such as
[Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks) can also be
used.

</admon>

The popular docker registry choice to be used with EKS is
[ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html)
(Elastic Container Registry). Make sure the EKS cluster has at least read access
to ECR.

### ECR

Make sure you have a repository in ECR where docker images can be uploaded. In
the sample screenshot below, there exists a `classifier` repository:

![alt text](/img/ecr.png)

### Using MLEM with ECR and EKS

Provided that the default kubeconfig file (present at `~/.kube/config`) can
communicate with EKS, execute the following command:

```cli
$ mlem deploy run kubernetes service_name \
    --model model \
    --registry ecr \
    --registry.account 342840881361 \
    --registry.region "us-east-1" \
    --registry.host "342840881361.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/classifier" \
    --image_name classifier --service_type loadbalancer

‚úÖ  Deployment classifier is up in mlem namespace
```

- Note that the repository name in ECR i.e. `classifier` has to match with the
  `image_name` supplied through `--image_name`

### Checking the docker images

One can check the docker image built via `docker image ls` which should give the
following output:

```
REPOSITORY                                                TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
342840881361.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/classifier   4ee45dc33804b58ee2c7f2f6be447cda   96afb03ad6f5   2 minutes ago   778MB
...
```

This can also be verified in ECR:

![alt text](/img/ecr_image.png)

### Checking the kubernetes resources

Pods created can be checked via `kubectl get pods -A` which should have a pod in
the `mlem` namespace present as shown below:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   aws-node-pr8cn                1/1     Running   0          11m
...
kube-system   kube-proxy-dfxsv              1/1     Running   0          11m
mlem          classifier-687655f977-h7wsl   1/1     Running   0          83s
```

Services created can be checked via `kubectl get svc -A` which should look like
the following:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)          AGE

mlem          classifier   LoadBalancer   10.100.87.16   a069daf48f9f244338a4bf5c60c6b823-1734837081.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   8080:32067/TCP   2m32s
```

### Making predictions via mlem or otherwise

One can clearly visit the External IP of the service `classifier` created by
`mlem` i.e.

**a069daf48f9f244338a4bf5c60c6b823-1734837081.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080**

using the browser and see the usual FastAPI docs page:

![alt text](/img/fastapi.png)

But one can also use the
[`mlem deployment apply`](/doc/command-reference/deployment/apply) command to
ping the deployed endpoint to get the predictions back. An example could be:

```cli
$ mlem deployment apply service_name data --json
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

i.e. `mlem` knows how to calculate the externally reachable endpoint given the
service type.

<admon type="info" title="A note about NodePort Service">

While the example discussed above deploys a LoadBalancer Service Type, but one
can also use NodePort (which is the default) OR via `--service_type nodeport`

While `mlem` knows how to calculate externally reachable IP address, make sure
the EC2 machine running the pod has external traffic allowed to it. This can be
configured in the inbound rules of the node's security group.

This can be seen as the last rule being added below:

![alt text](/img/inbound.png)

</admon>
