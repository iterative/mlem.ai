# What is MLEM

**MLEM** is an open-source Python tool, providing an easy and flexible way to
package and serve Machine Learning models.

**MLEM** allows you transform your models into Python modules to use
programmatically, or as fully deployable services packaged in easily shippable
Docker images.

**MLEM** defines standard interfaces and formats for datasets and models, and a
modular, flexible design. This allows supporting a wide variety of model types
and deployment targets, enabling you to easily serve models locally or on any
cloud infrastructure.
