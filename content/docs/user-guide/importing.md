# Importing existing files

If you already have your models/datasets saved, but want to use them as MLEM
Objects, you can use [`mlem import`](/doc/command-reference/import) or
[`mlem.api.import_object`](/doc/api-reference/import_object) commands.

They will try to load the path you provided and analyze the object saved there.

> Obviously, importing is more limited than `save` API, since MLEM do not have
> live python object to analyze and tries to recreate it, which may fail.

You can see list of available import implementations
[here](/doc/user-guide/mlem-abcs#importhook).
