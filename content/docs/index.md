# MLEM Documentation

**MLEM** is a tool to easily package, deploy and serve Machine Learning models.
It seamlessly supports a variety of scenarios like real-time serving and batch
processing.

<admon type="tip">

💡 When combined with [GTO](https://github.com/iterative/gto), MLEM allows you
to create a powerful Model Registry out of your Git repository! Such a registry
serves as a centralized place to store and operationalize your models along with
their metadata; manage model life-cycle, versions & releases, and easily
automate tests and deployments using GitOps.
