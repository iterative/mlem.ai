# Object reference

This section is for you if you want to see the detailed reference for
configuring MLEM Objects (such as
[what parameters are needed to configure a Kubernetes Deployment](/doc/object-reference/deployment/kubernetes)),
or if you're looking to support new functionality (to contribute back to MLEM or
just for your own use) and looking out for examples, such as:

- adding new [ML framework](/doc/object-reference/model),
- supporting new [data format](/doc/object-reference/data),
- adding another [building target for a model](/doc/object-reference/build),
- implementing new [server to serve a model](/doc/object-reference/serving),
- supporting new [deployment platform](/doc/object-reference/deployment),
- [resolving of URIs](/doc/object-reference/uri) of some special format, or
- [new storage type](/doc/object-reference/storage) to save MLEM objects to.

You can learn more about this on the
[Extending MLEM](/doc/object-reference/extending) page.
