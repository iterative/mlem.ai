# Storage extensions

Storage extensions add support for new types of location that MLEM can use to
store artifacts in [`save` API method](/doc/api-reference/save).

Typicaly they will implement [Storage](/doc/object-reference/mlem-abcs#storage)
and [Artifact](/doc/object-reference/mlem-abcs#artifact) interfaces.
