# Deploying models

You can also create deployments in cloud from your models.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This functionality is experimental and is subject to change. We‚Äôll add more
> target platforms in upcoming releases.

Deployment often uses packaging and serving functionalities. For example, Heroku
deployment that is showcased in this section actually uses docker image
packaging with FastAPI serving.

## Defining target environment

To deploy something somewhere, we need to define this ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù first, or in
MLEM terms, create a `target environment` object. It will contain all the
information needed to access it. In the case of Heroku, all we need is an API
key.

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏èHow to obtain Heroku API key

- Go to [heroku.com](http://heroku.com)
- Sign up or login with existing account
- Go to account settings by clicking your profile picture on the main page
- Find API Key section and reveal existing one or re-generate it

</details>

To create a new target env, run

```cli
$ mlem create env heroku staging -c api_key=<you api key>
üíæ Saving env to .mlem/env/staging.mlem
```

> Note that api_key argument is optional and MLEM will use `HEROKU_API_KEY` env
> variable if you don‚Äôt provide it via config.

## Defining deployment

Now, as we defined our target env, we can deploy our model there. Deployments
are also MLEM objects, which means that they need to have their definition. To
create one for Heroku, we once again will use `create` command to configure our
deployment.

```cli
$ mlem create deployment heroku myservice -c app_name=example-mlem-get-started -c model=rf -c env=staging
üíæ Saving deployment to .mlem/deployment/service_name.mlem
```

> üí° We use `example-mlem-get-started` for app_name, but you should change it to
> something unique.

<details>

### ‚õ≥ [Create deployment definition](https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/tree/5-deploy-meta)

```cli
$ git add .mlem/env/staging.mlem .mlem/deployment/myservice.mlem
$ git commit -m "Add env and deploy meta"
$ git diff 5-deploy-meta
```

</details>

Now we can actually run the deployment process (this can take a while):

```cli
$ mlem deploy create myservice
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading deployment from .mlem/deployment/myservice.mlem

```

> üí° You can also create and configure deployment on-the-fly using `-c` options
> for `mlem deploy create` command:
>
> `$ mlem deploy create service_name -m model -t staging -c app_name=example-mlem-get-started`

<details>

### ‚õ≥ [Service deployed](https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/tree/8-deploy-create)

```cli
$ git add .mlem/deployment/myservice.mlem
$ git commit -m "Deploy service"
$ git diff 8-deploy-service
```

</details>

## Making requests

You can go [here](http://example-mlem-get-started.herokuapp.com) and see the
same OpenAPI documentation. For details on it, refer to the **Serving** section.
You can also try to do some requests:

```py
from mlem.api import load
from mlem.runtime.client.base import HTTPClient

client = HTTPClient(host="http://example-mlem-get-started.herokuapp.com", port=80)
res = client.predict(load("test_x.csv"))
```

Also, you can create a client using deployment meta object:

```py
from mlem.api import load

service = load("myservice")
client = service.state.get_client()
res = client.predict(load("test_x.csv"))
```

There is also the remote counterpart of `apply` command. It will send requests
to your service instead of loading model into memory. There are two options to
achieve this in CLI: using the service address or the deploy meta.

```cli
$ mlem apply-remote http test_x.csv -c host=http://my-mlem-service.herokuapp.com -c port=80 --json
[1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0]

$ mlem deploy apply myservice test_x.csv --json
[1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0]
```

> üí° As always, you don‚Äôt need to have deployment meta locally:
>
> `$ mlem deploy apply https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/myservice https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/test_x.csv --json`

## Managing deployment

Finally, you can check the status of your service with:

```cli
$ mlem deploy status myservice
running
```

And stop your service with

```cli
$ mlem deploy teardown myservice
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading deployment from .mlem/deployment/myservice.mlem
üîó Loading link to .mlem/env/staging.mlem
üîª Deleting my-mlem-service heroku app
üíæ Updating deployment at .mlem/deployment/myservice.mlem
```

Note, that it will not delete the deployment definition, just update its state.
